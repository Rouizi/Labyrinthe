Your mission is to design and develop a small game to control a robot in a labyrinth. This game will have to be developed in console for reasons of accessibility. I called him ... Roboc.

The game is a labyrinth of obstacles: walls that are simply there to slow you down, doors that can be crossed and at least one point through which you can leave the labyrinth. If the robot arrives on this point, the game is considered won.

I made the game only with functions, no class, and the name of the functions is in French
